# README Morse code is a method of encoding text information as a series of on-off tones,clicks, or light flashes that can used for communication over a telegraph or  other communication device . It was invented by samuel morse and his collegues in the 18,30, morse code uses a serial of dots ( shorts signals) and dashes(long signals) to represent letters , numbers and puctuation marks, each letter and number has a unique sequence of dots and dashes that correspond to it,The code transmitted  as asrias of sound , light, or electrical impulse that can be decoded ny trained operator, Morse  code  was  widely used for telegraph communication in the past, but has largely been replace by mordern digital communication methods example of the morse code sequence for the letter (SOS) (" the international distress signal):...---...(dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dot-dot-dot) this sequence is easy to recognize and transmit, making it a useful code for emergency situation.
Morse code was created in 1830s by samuel morse and his colleague, Alfred vail and charles thomas, to address   the need for rapid long distance communication over telegraph line,At the time the telegraph  was a new technology that allows for the transmission of messages over wires, but it was slow and cumbersome,TELEGRAPH INVENTION-the telegraph was invented in the 1830s by samuel morse and his colleagues with the first telegraph line opening in 1844 between washington D.Cand baltimore maryland.SLOW TRANSMISSION-initially telegraph messages were transmitted using cumbersome system of numerical codes and mechanical switches which made transmittion slow and prone to errows.NEED SPEED-as the telegraph network expanded, there was a growing need for faster and more efficient communication,particularly for commercial and military purposees.INSPIRATION FRM EARLIER CODE-morse and his colleague drewinsperation frm earlier code, such as the french navy's numerical code and the british navy's flag signaling system.DEVELOPMENT OF MORSE CODE- morse code vail, and thomas developed a new code that used a series of dots and dashes to represent letter and numbers which could be trasmitted quickly and accurately over telegraph lines.FIRST USE- morse code was first used in 1844 for the telegraph line between wishington D,C and baltimore maryland and quickly become standard for telegraph communication.EXPANSION AND ADOPTION-morse code was adopted by telegraph companies and governments around the world,becoming the primary means of long distance communication for over a century the morse code was a response to the need for rapidand efficient communication over telegraph lines, and it played a significant role in the development of global communication network.
The morse system is a method of encoding text information as a series of on-off tones,click,or light flashes that can be used communication over a telegraph or other communication device we have the basic principles 1-letter and number: each letter and number was a unique morse code sequence assigned to do it. 2-dots and dashes:morse code uses two basic signal:dots(short signal)and dashes (long)3.code sequence each letter and nmber is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes,transmission the operator transmit the message by tapping the telegraph key,which send electrical impulse over telegraph line,  recieve the recieving oparator hears the sequence of dots and dashes as series of sound or sees them as series of light flashes,decoding the recieving operator decodes the message by translating the sequence of dots and dashes back into the original text
